 * The financial information that I am using is returned in fractions of a penny, e.g. 123.45 is Â£1, 23 pence, and 45
 * centi-pennies. The money lib on the other hand only supports entire pennies, and turns them from decimals into ints.
 *
 * To avoid having to remember to convert these each time I need to use the data, we will create a new Currency for use
 * with the Money library that correctly stores the information and then allows the values to be converted between the
 * two currencies.
 *
 * I'm using the code XFI, as X is used to denoted things which are "similar to currencies" in ISO-4217, FI to stand
 * for Financial Information, and XFI as it has not been assigned in the list yet
